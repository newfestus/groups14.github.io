            <h2>What are Programming Languages?</h2>
            <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to implement algorithms and manage the operation of machines. Early languages, such as Fortran (1957) and COBOL (1959), were developed for scientific and business applications, respectively.</p>
            <p>Programming languages have evolved over time to support different paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, functional, and declarative programming. Today, there are hundreds of programming languages, each suited for different types of tasks, from web development to data analysis.</p>

            <h2>Popular Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>Today, the world of programming is dominated by several key languages, each of which is tailored to specific kinds of tasks. For example, Python has emerged as a leading language for data science, machine learning, and automation, thanks to its simplicity and extensive libraries. Java is the go-to language for enterprise-level applications, especially in large-scale systems. Meanwhile, JavaScript is indispensable for web development, particularly for interactive web applications.</p>
            <p>Languages like C and C++ continue to play a critical role in system programming and embedded devices, where performance is crucial. Newer languages, such as Rust and Go, aim to address the challenges of concurrency and memory safety in modern computing environments.</p>
